The problem of generalization has been addressed formally in classical planning where provable correct policies that generalize over all instances of a given domain have been learned using combinatorial methods. The aim of this work is to bring these two research threads together to illuminate the conditions under which (deep) reinforcement learning approaches, and in particular, policy optimization methods, can be used to learn policies that generalize like combinatorial methods do. We draw on lessons learned from previous combinatorial and deep learning approaches, and extend them in a convenient way. From the former, we model policies as state transition classifiers, as (ground) actions are not general and change from instance to instance. From the latter, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) adapted to deal with relational structures for representing value functions over planning states, and in our case, policies. With these ingredients in place, we find that actor-critic methods can be used to learn policies that generalize almost as well as those obtained using combinatorial approaches while avoiding the scalability bottleneck and the use of feature pools. Moreover, the limitations of the DRL methods on the benchmarks considered have little to do with deep learning or reinforcement learning algorithms, and result from the well-understood expressive limitations of GNNs, and the tradeoff between optimality and generalization (general policies cannot be optimal in some domains). Both of these limitations are addressed without changing the basic DRL methods by adding derived predicates and an alternative cost structure to optimize.", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "submitted_at": "2025-12-22T13:08:58Z", "updated_at": "2025-12-22T13:08:58Z", "rl_tags": ["deep_rl"], "attention_score": 0.729, "collected_at": "2025-12-27T10:27:11.743937+00:00"}

Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a \"cross-task heterogeneity\" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data.

The study was conducted in authentic classroom contexts where students interacted with AI tools as part of programming learning activities to collect data on the four learning factors and students' perceptions. Using a multimethod quantitative analysis, which combined correlation analysis and text mining, we revealed markedly different dimensional structures between the two age groups. Middle school students exhibit strong positive correlations across all dimensions, indicating holistic evaluation patterns whereby positive perceptions in one dimension generalise to others. In contrast, high school students show weak or near-zero correlations between key dimensions, suggesting a more differentiated evaluation process in which dimensions are assessed independently.

PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials.

To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance.

In smooth regimes, the framework yields explicit stability exponents linking spectral norms, activation regularity, step sizes, and learning rates to contractivity of the learning dynamics. Classical spectral stability results for feedforward networks, a discrete CFL-type condition for residual architectures, and parametric and temporal stability laws for stochastic gradient methods arise as direct consequences. The theory extends to non-smooth learning systems, including ReLU networks, proximal and projected updates, and stochastic subgradient flows, by replacing classical derivatives with Clarke generalized derivatives and smooth energies with variational Lyapunov functionals.

To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{Schrödinger's Navigator}, a navigation framework inspired by Schrödinger's thought experiment on uncertainty. The framework treats unobserved space as a set of plausible future worlds and reasons over them before acting. Conditioned on egocentric visual inputs and three candidate trajectories, a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model imagines future observations along each path. This enables the agent to see beyond occlusions and anticipate risks in unseen regions without requiring extra detours or dense global mapping.

These updates guide the policy toward trajectories that avoid occlusions, reduce exposure to uncertain space, and better track moving targets. Experiments on a Go2 quadruped robot across three challenging scenarios, including severe static occlusions, unknown risks, and dynamically moving targets, show that Schrödinger's Navigator consistently outperforms strong ZSON baselines in self-localization, object localization, and overall Success Rate in occlusion-heavy environments.

In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions.

In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available.

To enable the unambiguous ranking of the experts by ability, several assumptions on $M$ are available in the literature. We consider here the general isotonic crowd-sourcing model, where $M$ is assumed to be isotonic up to an unknown permutation $π^*$ of the experts - namely, $M_{π^{*-1}(i),k} \\geq M_{π^{*-1}(i+1),k}$ for any $i\\in [n-1], k \\in [d]$.

A cross-task structural propagation module is introduced to model potential dependencies among nodes, enabling the model to understand complex structural patterns formed by resource contention, link interactions, and changes in service topology. To enhance adaptability to non-stationary behaviors, the framework incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism that automatically regulates internal feature flows according to system state changes, ensuring stable predictions in the presence of sudden load shifts, topology drift, and resource jitter. The experimental evaluation compares multiple models across various metrics and verifies the effectiveness of the framework through analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity. The results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance on several error metrics and provides more accurate representations of future states under different operating conditions.

With the emergence of high-fidelity and efficient representations such as 3D Gaussians, recent works have pushed toward ultra-detailed head avatars. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based analytic rigging or neural network-based deformation fields. While effective in constrained settings, both approaches often fail to generalize to unseen expressions and poses, particularly in extreme reenactment scenarios. Other methods constrain Gaussians to the global texel space of 3DMMs to reduce rendering complexity. However, these texel-based avatars tend to underutilize the underlying mesh structure. They apply minimal analytic deformation and rely heavily on neural regressors and heuristic regularization in UV space, which weakens geometric consistency and limits extrapolation to complex, out-of-distribution deformations. To address these limitations, we introduce TexAvatars, a hybrid avatar representation that combines the explicit geometric grounding of analytic rigging with the spatial continuity of texel space. Our approach predicts local geometric attributes in UV space via CNNs, but drives 3D deformation through mesh-aware Jacobians, enabling smooth and semantically meaningful transitions across triangle boundaries. This hybrid design separates semantic modeling from geometric control, resulting in improved generalization, interpretability, and stability.

While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns.

In this work, we propose a paradigm shift that bridges this gap by representing policies as human-interpretable source code and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as approximate interpreters. This programmatic representation allows us to operationalize the game-theoretic concept of \\textit{Program Equilibrium}.

We propose an online allocation algorithm with prediction based on the committed horizon control approach that leverages a \\emph{commitment level} to enforce the partial sequence of decisions. When this prediction becomes inaccurate, we further present a complementary online algorithm without predictions. An online policy selection algorithm is developed that learns the best policy from a pool constructed by varying the parameters of both algorithms. We prove that the prediction-based algorithm achieves tighter performance bounds as prediction error decreases, while the policy selection algorithm possesses a regret bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$.

We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($γ$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $γ$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\\mathbb{E}[θ]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).

Most existing defenses lack formal guarantees or rely on restrictive assumptions about the model class, attack type, extent of poisoning, or point-wise certification, limiting their practical reliability. This paper introduces a principled formal robustness certification framework that models gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system (dt-DS) and formulates poisoning robustness as a formal safety verification problem. By adapting the concept of barrier certificates (BCs) from control theory, we introduce sufficient conditions to certify a robust radius ensuring that the terminal model remains safe under worst-case ${\\ell}_p$-norm based poisoning. To make this practical, we parameterize BCs as neural networks trained on finite sets of poisoned trajectories. We further derive probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds by solving a scenario convex program (SCP), which yields a confidence lower bound on the certified robustness radius generalizing beyond the training set. Importantly, our framework also extends to certification against test-time attacks, making it the first unified framework to provide formal guarantees in both training and test-time attack settings.

Block low-rank (BLR) compression techniques address this challenge by learning compact representations of weight matrices. While traditional low-rank (LR) methods often incur sharp accuracy drops, BLR approaches such as Monarch and BLAST can better capture the underlying structure, thus preserving accuracy while reducing computations and memory footprints. In this work, we use roofline analysis to show that, although BLR methods achieve theoretical savings and practical speedups for single-token inference, multi-token inference often becomes memory-bound in practice, increasing latency despite compiler-level optimizations in PyTorch. To address this, we introduce custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for both Monarch and BLAST.

The core idea of \\texttt{FedMPDD} is to encode each client's high-dimensional gradient by computing its directional derivatives along multiple random vectors. This compresses the gradient into a much smaller message, significantly reducing uplink communication costs from $\\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(m)$, where $m \\ll d$.

This research bridges the gap between mechanistic physics and data driven learning by establishing a novel dual specialist ensemble framework that disentangles vulnerability into two distinct vectors, environmental contagion and structural fragility. The architecture integrates two specialized predictive streams, an environmental specialist, implemented as a graph neural network (GNN) that operationalizes the community as a directed contagion graph weighted by physics informed convection, radiation, and ember probabilities, and enriched with high dimensional Google AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, and a Structural Specialist, implemented via XGBoost to isolate granular asset level resilience. Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the framework reveals a critical dichotomy in risk drivers. The GNN demonstrates that neighborhood scale environmental pressure overwhelmingly dominates intrinsic structural features in defining propagation pathways, while the XGBoost model identifies eaves as the primary micro scale ingress vector. By synthesizing these divergent signals through logistic stacking, the ensemble achieves robust classification and generates a diagnostic risk topology.

Fung", "Martin Weiss", "Pulei Xiong", "Khalil Al-Hussaeni", "Claude Fachkha"], "abstract": "As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments, ensuring their safety and alignment with human values has become a paramount concern. Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant \"deliberative misalignment\", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation.

In many real-world scenarios, each agent maintains its own belief over the environment and must plan actions accordingly. However, most existing approaches assume that all agents have identical beliefs at planning time, implying these beliefs are conditioned on the same data. Such an assumption is often impractical due to limited communication. In reality, agents frequently operate with inconsistent beliefs, which can lead to poor coordination and suboptimal, potentially unsafe, performance. In this paper, we address this critical challenge by introducing a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies. Our approach provides probabilistic guarantees for both action consistency and performance with respect to open-loop multi-agent POMDP (which assumes all data is always communicated), and selectively triggers communication only when needed. Furthermore, we address another key aspect of whether, given a chosen joint action, the agents should share data to improve expected performance in inference.

We first examine why existing natural choices for quality functions are insufficient to solve the subgroup discovery problem for the Cox model. To address the shortcomings of existing metrics, we introduce two technical innovations: the *expected prediction entropy (EPE)*, a novel metric for evaluating survival models which predict a hazard function; and the *conditional rank statistics (CRS)*, a statistical object which quantifies the deviation of an individual point to the distribution of survival times in an existing subgroup. We study the EPE and CRS theoretically and show that they can solve many of the problems with existing metrics.\n  We introduce a total of eight algorithms for the Cox subgroup discovery problem. The main algorithm is able to take advantage of both the EPE and the CRS, allowing us to give theoretical correctness results for this algorithm in a well-specified setting. We evaluate all of the proposed methods empirically on both synthetic and real data. The experiments confirm our theory, showing that our contributions allow for the recovery of a ground-truth subgroup in well-specified cases, as well as leading to better model fit compared to naively fitting the Cox model to the whole dataset in practical settings.

Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries.

Global MagnetoHydroDynamic Shallow-Water Tachocline (MHD-SWT) models have shown potential to simulate such toroids, matching observations qualitatively. For week-scale early prediction of flare-producing AR emergence, forward-integration of these toroids is necessary. This requires model initialization with a dynamically self-consistent MHD state-vector that includes magnetic, flow fields, and shell-thickness variations. However, synoptic magnetograms provide only geometric shape of toroids, not the state-vector needed to initialize MHD-SWT models. To address this challenging task, we develop PINNBARDS, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-Based AR Distribution Simulator, that uses observational toroids and MHD-SWT equations to derive initial state-vector. Using Feb-14-2024 SDO/HMI synoptic map, we show that PINN converges to physically consistent, predominantly antisymmetric toroids, matching observed ones. Although surface data provides north and south toroids' central latitudes, and their latitudinal widths, they cannot determine tachocline field strengths, connected to AR emergence. We explore here solutions across a broad parameter range, finding hydrodynamically-dominated structures for weak fields (~2 kG) and overly rigid behavior for strong fields (~100 kG). We obtain best agreement with observations for 20-30 kG toroidal fields, and ~10 degree bandwidth, consistent with low-order longitudinal mode excitation.

Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average.

Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance.

To overcome this limitation, our framework requires only the computation of directional derivatives and a pre-basis for the Hilbert space domain, i.e., a linearly-independent set whose span is dense in the Hilbert space. This fully resolves the tractability issue, as pre-bases are much more easily obtained than full orthonormal bases or reproducing kernels -- which may not even exist -- and individual directional derivatives can be easily computed using forward-mode scalar automatic differentiation.

Under OAC-FL, every client modulates its intermediate parameters, such as gradient, onto the same set of orthogonal waveforms and simultaneously transmits the radio signal to the edge server. By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels, the edge server can obtain an automatically aggregated global gradient from the received signal. However, the limited number of orthogonal waveforms available in practical systems is fundamentally mismatched with the high dimensionality of modern deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose Freshness Freshness-mAgnItude awaRe top-k (FAIR-k), an algorithm that selects, in each communication round, the most impactful subset of gradients to be updated over the air. In essence, FAIR-k combines the complementary strengths of the Round-Robin and Top-k algorithms, striking a delicate balance between timeliness (freshness of parameter updates) and importance (gradient magnitude). Leveraging tools from Markov analysis, we characterize the distribution of parameter staleness under FAIR-k. Building on this, we establish the convergence rate of OAC-FL with FAIR-k, which discloses the joint effect of data heterogeneity, channel noise, and parameter staleness on the training efficiency. Notably, as opposed to conventional analyses that assume a universal Lipschitz constant across all the clients, our framework adopts a finer-grained model of the data heterogeneity.

However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \\textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \\textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback.

However, their increasing accessibility also raises heightened risks of misuse, such as generating harmful or unsafe content. To mitigate these risks, alignment techniques are commonly applied to align model behavior with human values. Despite these efforts, recent studies have shown that jailbreak attacks can circumvent alignment and elicit unsafe outputs. Currently, most existing jailbreak methods are tailored for open-source models and exhibit limited effectiveness against commercial MLLM-integrated systems, which often employ additional filters. These filters can detect and prevent malicious input and output content, significantly reducing jailbreak threats. In this paper, we reveal that the success of these safety filters heavily relies on a critical assumption that malicious content must be explicitly visible in either the input or the output. This assumption, while often valid for traditional LLM-integrated systems, breaks down in MLLM-integrated systems, where attackers can leverage multiple modalities to conceal adversarial intent, leading to a false sense of security in existing MLLM-integrated systems. To challenge this assumption, we propose Odysseus, a novel jailbreak paradigm that introduces dual steganography to covertly embed malicious queries and responses into benign-looking images. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Odysseus successfully jailbreaks several pioneering and realistic MLLM-integrated systems, achieving up to 99% attack success rate.

We introduce BRIDGE (Budget-Aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation), a two-phase framework that resolves these constraints through strategic intermediation and budget asymmetry. In Phase 1, a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA; e.g., about 7B) learns from the black-box teacher on a strictly limited subset of data (e.g., 3-5%), selected via a zero-API-cost pipeline that balances entropic difficulty and semantic diversity using only local TA inference. In Phase 2, we exploit this asymmetry-teacher queries are expensive, whereas TA inference is free to amplify supervision: the refined TA generates synthetic rationales for the full dataset to train the tiny student. Crucially, we apply an instruction-tuning curriculum to establish behavioral alignment in the tiny student before transferring reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRIDGE yields tighter generalization bounds than direct distillation when data is abundant. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements: BRIDGE delivers student performance gains of 28-41%, closing the capability gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16% while using 10x fewer teacher queries.

In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed \"thinking\" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open \"thinking\" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed \"thinking\" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives.

In the original framework, each ML-generated candidate model is embedded in a CFD solver and evaluated against reference data, requiring hundreds to thousands of high-fidelity simulations and resulting in prohibitive computational cost for complex flows. To overcome this limitation, we propose an extended framework that integrates surrogate modeling into symbolic CFD-driven training in real time to reduce training cost. The surrogate model learns to approximate the errors of ML-generated models based on previous CFD evaluations and is continuously refined during training. Newly generated models are first assessed using the surrogate, and only those predicted to yield small errors or high uncertainty are subsequently evaluated with full CFD simulations. Discrete expressions generated by symbolic regression are mapped into a continuous space using averaged input-symbol values as inputs to a probabilistic surrogate model. To support multi-objective model training, particularly when fixed weighting of competing quantities is challenging, the surrogate is extended to a multi-output formulation by generalizing the kernel to a matrix form, providing one mean and variance prediction per training objective. Selection metrics based on these probabilistic outputs are used to identify an optimal training setup.

This surrogate set is constructed to be semantically derived from $D_u$ yet sufficiently distinct in embedding space. By comparing unlearning metric scores between $D_u$ and $\\tilde{D}_u$, we can stress-test the reliability of the metric itself. Our extensive evaluation across three LLM families (Llama-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Zephyr-7B-$β$), three distinct datasets, and seven standard metrics reveals widespread inconsistencies. We find that current metrics frequently overestimate unlearning success, failing to detect retained knowledge exposed by our stress-test datasets.", "categories": ["cs.CR", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "submitted_at": "2025-12-22T04:42:41Z", "updated_at": "2025-12-23T03:34:28Z", "rl_tags": ["general_dl"], "attention_score": 0.686, "collected_at": "2025-12-27T10:27:18.317054+00:00"}

ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps.

Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

However, most existing applications are limited to identifying objects alone, without considering their associated states. The ability to recognize both the state and object simultaneously remains less common. One approach to address this is by treating state and object as a single category during training. However, this approach poses challenges in data collection and training since it requires comprehensive data for all possible combinations. Compositional Zero-shot Learning (CZSL) emerges as a viable solution by treating the state and object as distinct categories during training. CZSL facilitates the identification of novel compositions even in the absence of data for every conceivable combination. The current state-of-the-art method, KG-SP, addresses this issue by training distinct classifiers for states and objects, while leveraging a semantic model to evaluate the plausibility of composed compositions. However, KG-SP's accuracy in state and object recognition can be further improved, and it fails to consider the weighting of states and objects during composition. In this study, we propose SASOW, an enhancement of KG-SP that considers the weighting of states and objects while improving composition recognition accuracy. First, we introduce self-attention mechanisms into the classifiers for states and objects, leading to enhanced accuracy in recognizing both.

Score-based tests are appealing because they require fitting the model only once under the null. However, extending them to powerful nonparametric alternatives is difficult due to the lack of suitable score functions. Through a class of exponentially tilted models, we show that the resulting score-based GoF tests are equivalent to the tests based on integral probability metrics (IPMs) indexed by a function class. When the class is rich, the test is universally consistent. This simple yet insightful perspective enables reinterpretation of classical distance-based testing procedures-including those based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, Wasserstein-1 distance, and maximum mean discrepancy-as arising from score-based constructions. Building on this insight, we propose a new nonparametric score-based GoF test through a special class of IPM induced by kernelized Stein's function class, called semiparametric kernelized Stein discrepancy (SKSD) test. Compared with other nonparametric score-based tests, the SKSD test is computationally efficient and accommodates general nuisance-parameter estimators, supported by a generic parametric bootstrap procedure. The SKSD test is universally consistent and attains Pitman efficiency. Moreover, SKSD test provides simple GoF tests for models with intractable likelihoods but tractable scores with the help of Stein's identity and we use two popular models, kernel exponential family and conditional Gaussian models, to illustrate the power of our method.

OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision.

It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CY"], "submitted_at": "2025-12-23T02:36:56Z", "updated_at": "2025-12-23T02:36:56Z", "rl_tags": ["exploration"], "attention_score": 0.729, "collected_at": "2025-12-27T10:27:18.723748+00:00"}

The approach explores depth, parametrized gate configurations, and flexible data re-uploading patterns, formulating the construction of quantum regressors as an optimization process. The discovered circuits are evaluated against seventeen classical regression models on twenty-two nonlinear benchmark functions and four analytical functions.

Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \\ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors.

One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension.

We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research.

Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models.

Quantum feature maps embed data into high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, enabling the use of expressive similarity measures and compact classifiers. Building on this motivation, we compare quantum-kernel SVMs (QSVMs) with classical SVMs using identical mel-spectrogram preprocessing and stratified 5-fold cross-validation across four corpora (ASVspoof 2019 LA, ASVspoof 5 (2024), ADD23, and an In-the-Wild set).

In AI interpretability, reports of similar ''dead salmon'' artifacts abound: feature attribution, probing, sparse auto-encoding, and even causal analyses can produce plausible-looking explanations for randomly initialized neural networks. In this work, we examine this phenomenon and argue for a pragmatic statistical-causal reframing: explanations of computational systems should be treated as parameters of a (statistical) model, inferred from computational traces. This perspective goes beyond simply measuring statistical variability of explanations due to finite sampling of input data; interpretability methods become statistical estimators, and findings should be tested against explicit and meaningful alternative computational hypotheses, with uncertainty quantified with respect to the postulated statistical model. It also highlights important theoretical issues, such as the identifiability of common interpretability queries, which we argue is critical to understand the field's susceptibility to false discoveries, poor generalizability, and high variance.

By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception.

CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction.

Existing semi-supervised methods typically treat data as purely numerical and} in a deterministic manner, thereby neglecting the heterogeneity and uncertainty inherent in complex, real-world datasets. This paper introduces a label-informed outlier detection method for heterogeneous data based on Granular Computing and Fuzzy Sets, namely Granule Density-based Outlier Factor (GDOF). Specifically, GDOF first employs label-informed fuzzy granulation to effectively represent various data types and develops granule density for precise density estimation. Subsequently, granule densities from individual attributes are integrated for outlier scoring by assessing attribute relevance with a limited number of labeled outliers. Experimental results on various real-world datasets show that GDOF stands out in detecting outliers in heterogeneous data with a minimal number of labeled outliers. The integration of Fuzzy Sets and Granular Computing in GDOF offers a practical framework for outlier detection in complex and diverse data types.

While existing jailbreak studies explore both single-turn and multi-turn strategies, most implicitly assume a static safety boundary and fail to account for how contextual interactions dynamically influence model behavior, leading to limited stability and generalization. Motivated by this gap, we propose MEEA (Mere Exposure Effect Attack), a psychology-inspired, fully automated black-box framework for evaluating multi-turn safety robustness, grounded in the mere exposure effect. MEEA leverages repeated low-toxicity semantic exposure to induce a gradual shift in a model's effective safety threshold, enabling progressive erosion of alignment constraints over sustained interactions. Concretely, MEEA constructs semantically progressive prompt chains and optimizes them using a simulated annealing strategy guided by semantic similarity, toxicity, and jailbreak effectiveness. Extensive experiments on both closed-source and open-source models, including GPT-4, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate that MEEA consistently achieves higher attack success rates than seven representative baselines, with an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) improvement exceeding 20%. Ablation studies further validate the necessity of both annealing-based optimization and contextual exposure mechanisms. Beyond improved attack effectiveness, our findings indicate that LLM safety behavior is inherently dynamic and history-dependent, challenging the common assumption of static alignment boundaries and highlighting the need for interaction-aware safety evaluation and defense mechanisms.

However, the principles behind inference time scaling are not well understood. In this paper, we introduce an analytically tractable model of inference-time scaling: Bayesian linear regression with a reward-weighted sampler, where the reward is determined from a linear model, modeling LLM-as-a-judge scenario. We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance. We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model. We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward. When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error. For fixed $k$, there exists an optimal sampling temperature. We experimentally verify these facts in large language model inference with an additional large language model as a judge. In the \"best-of-$k$\" limit with the teacher as reward, we theoretically show that the generalization error decays as $Θ(1/k^2)$ and determine the leading coefficient via extreme value theory.

In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers.

To further enhance multi-branch feature fusion, we propose a Fusion of Multiscale Features via Centralized Sparse-attention Network (EEG-CSANet), a centralized sparse-attention network. It employs a main-auxiliary branch architecture, where the main branch models core spatiotemporal patterns via multiscale self-attention, and the auxiliary branch facilitates efficient local interactions through sparse cross-attention. Experimental results show that EEG-CSANet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across five public datasets (BCIC-IV-2A, BCIC-IV-2B, HGD, SEED, and SEED-VIG), with accuracies of 88.54%, 91.09%, 99.43%, 96.03%, and 90.56%, respectively. Such performance demonstrates its strong adaptability and robustness across various EEG decoding tasks. Moreover, extensive ablation studies are conducted to enhance the interpretability of EEG-CSANet.

In this work, we explore a new type of ROM that is not constrained to fixed weights, based on neural Galerkin-Projections, which is an initial value problem that encodes the physics of the governing PDEs, calibrated via neural networks to accurately model the trajectory of these weights. Then using a statistical hierarchical pooling technique to learn a distribution on the initial values of the temporal weights, we can create new, statistically interpretable and physically justified weights that are generalized to many similar problems.

This disconnect causes current methods to struggle with occluded areas and complex camera trajectories. To bridge this gap, we propose WorldWarp, a framework that couples a 3D structural anchor with a 2D generative refiner. To establish geometric grounding, WorldWarp maintains an online 3D geometric cache built via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly warping historical content into novel views, this cache acts as a structural scaffold, ensuring each new frame respects prior geometry. However, static warping inevitably leaves holes and artifacts due to occlusions. We address this using a Spatio-Temporal Diffusion (ST-Diff) model designed for a \"fill-and-revise\" objective.

By dynamically updating the 3D cache at every step, WorldWarp maintains consistency across video chunks. Consequently, it achieves state-of-the-art fidelity by ensuring that 3D logic guides structure while diffusion logic perfects texture.

Our key idea is to decouple the rendering into two branches: event-by-event geometry (depth) rendering and snapshot-based radiance (intensity) rendering, by using ray-tracing and the image of warped events. The extensive evaluation shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the real-world datasets and competitive performance on the synthetic dataset. Also, the proposed method works without prior information (e.g., pretrained image reconstruction models) or COLMAP-based initialization, is more flexible in the event selection number, and achieves sharp reconstruction on scene edges with fast training time. We hope that this work deepens our understanding of the sparse nature of events for 3D reconstruction.

Focusing on a minimal trigger-output prediction task -- copying the token immediately following a special trigger upon its second occurrence -- we present a rigorous analysis of gradient-based training of a single-layer transformer. In both the infinite and finite sample regimes, we prove a transition in the learned mechanism: if input sequences exhibit sufficient diversity, measured by a low ``max-sum'' ratio of trigger-to-trigger distances, the trained model implements an induction head and generalizes to unseen contexts; by contrast, when this ratio is large, the model resorts to a positional shortcut and fails to generalize out-of-distribution (OOD). We also reveal a trade-off between the pretraining context length and OOD generalization, and derive the optimal pretraining distribution that minimizes computational cost per sample. Finally, we validate our theoretical predictions with controlled synthetic experiments, demonstrating that broadening context distributions robustly induces induction heads and enables OOD generalization.

While general-domain vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perform well on natural image tasks, they struggle in medical domain applications, particularly in cross-modal retrieval for ophthalmological images. We propose a novel knowledge-enhanced joint embedding framework that integrates retinal fundus images, clinical text, and structured patient data through a multimodal transformer architecture to address the critical gap in medical image-text alignment. Our approach employs separate encoders for each modality: a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) for retinal images, Bio-ClinicalBERT for clinical narratives, and a multilayer perceptron for structured demographic and clinical features. These modalities are fused through a joint transformer with modality-specific embeddings, trained using multiple objectives including contrastive losses between modality pairs, reconstruction losses for images and text, and classification losses for DR severity grading according to ICDR and SDRG schemes. Experimental results on the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET) demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models.

In practice, error accumulation can become unacceptable beyond the training horizon, and existing methods lack mechanisms for online monitoring or correction. To address this gap, we propose ANCHOR (Adaptive Numerical Correction for High-fidelity Operator Rollouts), an online, instance-aware hybrid inference framework for stable long-horizon prediction of nonlinear, time-dependent PDEs. ANCHOR treats a pretrained NO as the primary inference engine and adaptively couples it with a classical numerical solver using a physics-informed, residual-based error estimator. Inspired by adaptive time-stepping in numerical analysis, ANCHOR monitors an exponential moving average (EMA) of the normalized PDE residual to detect accumulating error and trigger corrective solver interventions without requiring access to ground-truth solutions. We show that the EMA-based estimator correlates strongly with the true relative L2 error, enabling data-free, instance-aware error control during inference. Evaluations on four canonical PDEs: 1D and 2D Burgers', 2D Allen-Cahn, and 3D heat conduction, demonstrate that ANCHOR reliably bounds long-horizon error growth, stabilizes extrapolative rollouts, and significantly improves robustness over standalone neural operators, while remaining substantially more efficient than high-fidelity numerical solvers.", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CE"], "submitted_at": "2025-12-22T18:17:28Z", "updated_at": "2025-12-22T18:17:28Z", "rl_tags": ["general_dl"], "attention_score": 0.729, "collected_at": "2025-12-27T10:27:19.378872+00:00"}

Current and future low-noise, multi-frequency observations enable sufficient precision to address the first two of these challenges such that secondary $B$ modes will become the bottleneck for improved constraints on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. The dominant source of secondary $B$-mode polarization is gravitational lensing by large scale structure. Various strategies have been developed to estimate the lensing deflection and to reverse its effects the CMB, thus reducing confusion from lensing $B$ modes in the search for primordial gravitational waves. However, a few complications remain. First, there may be additional sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, for example from patchy reionization or from cosmic polarization rotation. Second, the statistics of delensed CMB maps can become complicated and non-Gaussian, especially when advanced lensing reconstruction techniques are applied. We previously demonstrated how a deep learning network, ResUNet-CMB, can provide nearly optimal simultaneous estimates of multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization.

We specify reflective knowledge as follows: agents understand the evaluative basis of a claim, when that basis is unavailable agents consistently assess the reliability of truth sources, and agents have a duty to apply these standards within their domains of competence. We argue that LLMs approximate externalist reliabilism because they can reliably transmit information whose justificatory basis is established elsewhere, but they do not themselves possess reflective justification.

To quantify this complexity, we use multi-order interactions [57], where each order reflects the amount of contextual information required to evaluate the joint interaction utility of a variable pair. This formulation enables a stratified analysis of cooperative patterns learned by DNNs. Building on this formulation, we develop a comprehensive study of interaction structure in DNNs. (i) We empirically discover a universal interaction bottleneck: across architectures and tasks, DNNs easily learn low-order and high-order interactions but consistently under-represent mid-order ones. (ii) We theoretically explain this bottleneck by proving that mid-order interactions incur the highest contextual variability, yielding large gradient variance and making them intrinsically difficult to learn. (iii) We further modulate the bottleneck by introducing losses that steer models toward emphasizing interactions of selected orders. Finally, we connect microscopic interaction structures with macroscopic representational behavior: low-order-emphasized models exhibit stronger generalization and robustness, whereas high-order-emphasized models demonstrate greater structural modeling and fitting capability.

However, learning-based scheduling on unrelated parallel machines remains particularly difficult to design. Not only do the numbers of jobs and machines vary, but each job-machine pair has a unique processing time, dynamically altering feature dimensions. We propose a novel approach with a neural network tailored for offline deterministic scheduling of arbitrary sizes on unrelated machines. The goal is to minimize a complex objective function that includes the makespan and the weighted tardiness of jobs and machines. Unlike existing online approaches, which process jobs sequentially, our method generates a complete schedule considering the entire input at once. The key contribution of this work lies in the sophisticated architecture of our model. By leveraging various NLP-inspired architectures, it effectively processes any number of jobs and machines with varying feature dimensions imposed by unrelated processing times. Our approach enables supervised training on small problem instances while demonstrating strong generalization to much larger scheduling environments. Trained and tested on instances with 8 jobs and 4 machines, costs were only 2.51% above optimal. Across all tested configurations of up to 100 jobs and 10 machines, our network consistently outperformed an advanced dispatching rule, which incurred 22.22% higher costs on average.

Anatomy understanding tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies. While recent work has demonstrated that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can enhance reasoning in MLLMs without relying on large amounts of data, we find two weaknesses that hinder GRPO's reasoning performance in anatomy recognition: 1) knowledge cannot be effectively shared between different anatomical structures, resulting in uneven information gain and preventing the model from converging, and 2) the model quickly converges to a single reasoning path, suppressing the exploration of diverse strategies. To overcome these challenges, we propose two novel methods. First, we implement a progressive learning strategy called Anatomical Similarity Curriculum Learning by controlling question difficulty via the similarity of answer choices, enabling the model to master complex problems incrementally. Second, we utilize question augmentation referred to as Group Diversity Question Augmentation to expand the model's search space for difficult queries, mitigating the tendency to produce uniform responses.

Most research to-date builds on domain-knowledge-based corruption risk indicators of individual contract-level features and some also analyzes contracting network patterns. A critical barrier for supervised machine learning is the absence of confirmed non-corrupt, negative, examples, which makes conventional machine learning inappropriate for this task. Using publicly available data on federally funded procurement in Mexico and company sanction records, this study implements positive-unlabeled (PU) learning algorithms that integrate domain-knowledge-based red flags with network-derived features to identify likely corrupt and fraudulent contracts. The best-performing PU model on average captures 32 percent more known positives and performs on average 2.3 times better than random guessing, substantially outperforming approaches based solely on traditional red flags. The analysis of the Shapley Additive Explanations reveals that network-derived features, particularly those associated with contracts in the network core or suppliers with high eigenvector centrality, are the most important. Traditional red flags further enhance model performance in line with expectations, albeit mainly for contracts awarded through competitive tenders.

Evaluating the dynamics in such models is key to understanding their learned generative mechanisms. However, such evaluation is impeded by two major challenges: First, comparison of learned dynamics across models is difficult because there is no enforced equivalence of their coordinate systems. Second, identification of mechanistically important low-dimensional motifs (e.g., limit sets) is intractable in high-dimensional nonlinear models such as RNNs. Here, we propose a comprehensive framework to address these two issues, termed Diffeomorphic vector field alignment FOR learned Models (DFORM). DFORM learns a nonlinear coordinate transformation between the state spaces of two dynamical systems, which aligns their trajectories in a maximally one-to-one manner. In so doing, DFORM enables an assessment of whether two models exhibit topological equivalence, i.e., similar mechanisms despite differences in coordinate systems. A byproduct of this method is a means to locate dynamical motifs on low-dimensional manifolds embedded within higher-dimensional systems. We verified DFORM's ability to identify linear and nonlinear coordinate transformations using canonical topologically equivalent systems, RNNs, and systems related by nonlinear flows. DFORM was also shown to provide a quantification of similarity between topologically distinct systems. We then demonstrated that DFORM can locate important dynamical motifs including invariant manifolds and saddle limit sets within high-dimensional models. Finally, using a set of RNN models trained on human functional MRI (fMRI) recordings, we illustrated that DFORM can identify limit cycles from high-dimensional data-driven models, which agreed well with prior numerical analysis.", "categories": ["cs.LG", "eess.SY", "q-bio.NC"], "submitted_at": "2025-12-21T02:23:05Z", "updated_at": "2025-12-21T02:23:05Z", "rl_tags": ["general_dl"], "attention_score": 0.643, "collected_at": "2025-12-27T10:27:19.838917+00:00"}

We introduce Generative Latent Unification of Expertise-Informed Engineering Models (GLUE), which orchestrates pre-trained, frozen subsystem generators while enforcing system-level feasibility, optimality, and diversity. We propose and benchmark (i) data-driven GLUE models trained on pre-generated system-level designs and (ii) a data-free GLUE model trained online on a differentiable geometry layer.

This paper presents a robust detection framework that leverages multiple uncertainty measures to decide whether to trust or reject a model's predictions. We focus on three complementary techniques: Fisher Information, which captures the sensitivity of model parameters to input variations; entropy-based uncertainty from Monte Carlo Dropout, which reflects predictive variability; and predictive variance from a Deep Kernel Learning framework using a Gaussian Process classifier. To integrate these diverse uncertainty signals, Particle Swarm Optimisation is used to learn optimal weightings and determine an adaptive rejection threshold. The model is trained on Stable Diffusion-generated images and evaluated on GLIDE, VQDM, Midjourney, BigGAN, and StyleGAN3, each introducing significant distribution shifts. While standard metrics such as prediction probability and Fisher-based measures perform well in distribution, their effectiveness degrades under shift. In contrast, the Combined Uncertainty measure consistently achieves an incorrect rejection rate of approximately 70 percent on unseen generators, successfully filtering most misclassified AI samples. Although the system occasionally rejects correct predictions from newer generators, this conservative behaviour is acceptable, as rejected samples can support retraining. The framework maintains high acceptance of accurate predictions for natural images and in-domain AI data.

In this work, we introduce an inverse scattering inspired Fourier Neural Operator(IS-FNO), motivated by the reversibility and spectral evolution structure underlying the classical inverse scattering transform. The proposed architecture enforces a near-reversible pairing between lifting and projection maps through an explicitly invertible neural transformation, and models latent temporal evolution using exponential Fourier layers that naturally encode linear and nonlinear spectral dynamics.

To address this architectural limitation, we rethink deep image watermarking by reformulating embedding and extraction as explicitly collaborative components. To realize this reformulation, we introduce a Collaborative Interaction Mechanism (CIM) that establishes direct, bidirectional communication between the embedder and extractor, enabling a mutual-teacher training paradigm and coordinated optimization. Built upon this explicitly collaborative architecture, we further propose an Adaptive Feature Modulation Module (AFMM) to support effective interaction.

We argue that standard multi-head attention is best seen as a form of tensor lifting: hidden vectors are mapped into a high-dimensional space of pairwise interactions, and learning proceeds by constraining this lifted tensor through gradient descent. This mechanism is extremely expressive but mathematically opaque, because after many layers it becomes very hard to describe the model with a small family of explicit invariants.\n  To explore an alternative, we propose an attention-free architecture based on Grassmann flows. Instead of forming an L by L attention matrix, our Causal Grassmann layer (i) linearly reduces token states, (ii) encodes local token pairs as two-dimensional subspaces on a Grassmann manifold via Plucker coordinates, and (iii) fuses these geometric features back into the hidden states through gated mixing. Information therefore propagates by controlled deformations of low-rank subspaces over multi-scale local windows, so the core computation lives on a finite-dimensional manifold rather than in an unstructured tensor space.\n  On the Wikitext-2 language modeling benchmark, purely Grassmann-based models with 13 to 18 million parameters achieve validation perplexities within about 10 to 15 percent of size-matched Transformers.

We argue that learnability in dynamical systems should be studied as a finite-sample question, and be based on the properties of the underlying dynamics rather than the statistical properties of the resulting sequence. To this end, we give a formulation of learnability for stochastic processes induced by dynamical systems, focusing on guarantees that hold uniformly at every time step after a finite burn-in period.

Using the SMN4Lang MEG dataset, we construct a word-level brain atlas of phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extract latent axes via ICA. We validate axes with independent lexica and NER-based labels (POS/log-frequency used as sanity checks), then train lightweight adapters that map LLM hidden states to these brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM. Steering along the resulting brain-derived directions yields a robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in a mid TinyLlama layer, surviving perplexity-matched controls, and a brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts (relative to the text probe) with lower perplexity for the brain axis. A function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering in TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2, with PPL-matched text-level corroboration. Layer-4 effects in TinyLlama are large but inconsistent, so we treat them as secondary (Appendix).

To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoTrail-GUI, a novel framework designed to mimic human-like experiential learning by equipping agents with a dynamic, accessible memory. Our framework operates in three distinct stages. First, during Experience Exploration, an agent autonomously interacts with GUI environments to build a curated database of successful task trajectories, validated by a reward model. Crucially, the entire knowledge base construction is thus fully automated, requiring no human supervision. Second, in the Memory Injection stage, upon receiving a new task, our system efficiently retrieves the most relevant past trajectories to serve as actionable ''memories''. Finally, during GUI Task Inference, these memories are injected as in-context guidance to inform the agent's reasoning and decision-making process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on benchmarks including Android World and AndroidLab.

This study systematically compares POD with several AE variants (Linear, Nonlinear, Convolutional, and Variational) using left ventricular flow fields obtained from computational fluid dynamics simulations. We show that, for a suitably chosen latent dimension, AEs produce modes that become nearly orthogonal and qualitatively resemble POD modes that capture a given percentage of kinetic energy. As the number of latent modes increases, AE modes progressively lose orthogonality, leading to linear dependence, spatial redundancy, and the appearance of repeated modes with substantial high-frequency content. This degradation reduces interpretability and introduces noise-like components into AE-based reduced-order models, potentially complicating their integration with physics-based formulations or neural-network surrogates.

Beyond parameter efficiency with $O(LN + LG)$ scaling (where $G$ is the knot count of the shared splines) versus MLPs' $O(LN^2)$, SNs admit a sequential evaluation strategy that reduces peak forward-intermediate memory from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ (treating batch size as constant), making much wider architectures feasible under memory constraints.

When experience is represented as a linear trajectory in Euclidean space, the geodesic distance between temporal events grows linearly with time, forcing the required covering number to diverge. In fixed-dimensional hardware, this volume expansion inevitably forces trajectory overlap, manifesting as catastrophic interference. In this work, we propose a geometric resolution to this paradox based on Recursive Metric Contraction. We formalize abstraction not as symbolic grouping, but as a topological deformation: a quotient map that collapses the metric tensor within validated temporal neighborhoods, effectively driving the diameter of local sub-manifolds to zero. We substantiate our framework with four rigorous results. First, the Bounded Capacity Theorem establishes that recursive quotient maps allow the embedding of arbitrarily long trajectories into bounded representational volumes, trading linear metric growth for logarithmic topological depth. Second, the Topological Collapse Separability Theorem, derived via Urysohn's Lemma, proves that recursive quotienting renders non-linearly separable temporal sequences linearly separable in the limit, bypassing the need for infinite-dimensional kernel projections. Third, the Parity-Partitioned Stability Theorem solves the catastrophic forgetting problem by proving that if the state space is partitioned into orthogonal flow and scaffold manifolds, the metric deformations of active learning do not disturb the stability of stored memories.

The question is how to learn goal-conditioned and general policies when the training instances are large and the goal cannot be reached by random exploration alone. The technique of Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) provides an answer to this question: it relabels unsuccessful trajectories as successful ones by replacing the original goal with one that was actually achieved. If the target policy must generalize across states and goals, trajectories that do not reach the original goal states can enable more data- and time-efficient learning. In this work, we show that further performance gains can be achieved when states and goals are represented by sets of atoms.

In the last decade, deep learning recommender models (DLRMs) are the de-facto standard in this field. The main bottleneck in DLRM inference is the lookup of sparse features across huge embedding tables, which are usually partitioned across the aggregate RAM of many nodes. In state-of-the-art recommender systems, the distributed lookup is implemented via irregular all-to-all (alltoallv) communication, and often presents the main bottleneck. Today, most related work sees this operation as a given; in addition, every collective is synchronous in nature. In this work, we propose a novel bounded lag synchronous (BLS) version of the alltoallv operation. The bound can be a parameter allowing slower processes to lag behind entire iterations before the fastest processes block. In special applications such as inference-only DLRM, the accuracy of the application is fully preserved. We implement BLS alltoallv in a new PyTorch Distributed backend and evaluate it with a BLS version of the reference DLRM code. We show that for well balanced, homogeneous-access DLRM runs our BLS technique does not offer notable advantages.

Here, we present a probabilistic OOD detection framework for complex 3D graph data built on a diffusion model that learns a density of the training distribution in a fully unsupervised manner. A key ingredient we introduce is a unified continuous diffusion over both 3D coordinates and discrete features: categorical identities are embedded in a continuous space and trained with cross-entropy, while the corresponding diffusion score is obtained analytically via posterior-mean interpolation from predicted class probabilities. This yields a single self-consistent probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE) that produces per-sample log-likelihoods, providing a principled typicality score for distribution shift. We validate the approach on protein-ligand complexes and construct strict OOD datasets by withholding entire protein families from training.

For bounded activation functions, we show that (under mild conditions) all eventually constant activations yield the same expressive power - numerical and Boolean - and that it subsumes previously established logics for GNNs with eventually constant activation functions but without linear layers. Finally, we prove the first expressive separation between unbounded and bounded activations in the presence of linear layers: MPLang with ReLU is strictly more powerful for numerical queries than MPLang with eventually constant activation functions, e.g., truncated ReLU.

Model merging aims to merge the distinct capabilities of these specialised models into a unified model, requiring minimal or even no additional training. A core objective of model merging is to ensure the merged model retains the behavioural characteristics of the specialised models, typically achieved through feature alignment. We identify that features consist of two critical components: direction and magnitude. Prior research has predominantly focused on directional alignment, while the influence of magnitude remains largely neglected, despite its pronounced vulnerability to perturbations introduced by common merging operations (e.g., parameter fusion and sparsification). Such perturbations to magnitude inevitably lead to feature deviations in the merged model from the specialised models, resulting in subsequent performance degradation. To address this, we propose MAGnItude Calibration (MAGIC), a plug-and-play framework that rectifies layer-wise magnitudes in feature and weight spaces, with three variants. Specifically, our Feature Space Calibration (FSC) realigns the merged model's features using a small set of unlabelled data, while Weight Space Calibration (WSC) extends this calibration to the weight space without requiring additional data. Combining these yields Dual Space Calibration (DSC).

We propose an agent-based framework for detecting drift and assessing its severity in multisite clinical AI systems. To evaluate its effectiveness, we simulate a multi-center environment for output-based drift detection, assigning each site a drift monitoring agent that performs batch-wise comparisons of model outputs against a reference distribution. We analyse several multi-center monitoring schemes, that differ in how the reference is obtained (site-specific, global, production-only and adaptive), alongside a centralized baseline. Results on real-world breast cancer imaging data using a pathological complete response prediction model shows that all multi-center schemes outperform centralized monitoring, with F1-score improvements up to 10.3% in drift detection. In the absence of site-specific references, the adaptive scheme performs best, with F1-scores of 74.3% for drift detection and 83.7% for drift severity classification.

To address the limitations of this model, this paper introduces Decentralised Preference Discovery (DPD), the problem of determining the collective will of an electorate under constraints of censorship resistance, partial information, and asynchronous communication. We propose Snowveil, a novel framework for this task. Snowveil uses an iterative, gossip-based protocol where voters repeatedly sample the preferences of a small, random subset of the electorate to progressively converge on a collective outcome. We demonstrate the framework's modularity by designing the Constrained Hybrid Borda (CHB), a novel aggregation rule engineered to balance broad consensus with strong plurality support, and provide a rigorous axiomatic analysis of its properties. By applying a potential function and submartingale theory, we develop a multi-level analytical method to show that the system almost surely converges to a stable, single-winner in finite time, a process that can then be iterated to construct a set of winning candidates for multi-winner scenarios. This technique is largely agnostic to the specific aggregation rule, requiring only that it satisfies core social choice axioms like Positive Responsiveness, thus offering a formal toolkit for a wider class of DPD protocols. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive empirical analysis through extensive simulation, validating Snowveil's $O(n)$ scalability.

Conventional centralized routing algorithms and monolithic graph neural network (GNN) models suffer from limited scalability, high latency, and poor real-time adaptability, which restricts their effectiveness in large urban logistics systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network (HSTE-GNN) for dynamic routing over ultra-large road networks. The framework partitions the city-scale graph into regional subgraphs processed in parallel across distributed computing nodes, enabling efficient learning of localized traffic dynamics. Within each region, an edge-enhanced spatio-temporal module jointly models node states, dynamic edge attributes, and short-term temporal dependencies. A hierarchical coordination layer further aggregates cross-region representations through an asynchronous parameter-server mechanism, ensuring global routing coherence under high-frequency traffic updates. This distributed hierarchical design balances local responsiveness with global consistency, significantly improving scalability and inference efficiency. Experiments on real-world large-scale traffic datasets from Beijing and New York demonstrate that HSTE-GNN outperforms strong spatio-temporal baselines such as ST-GRAPH, achieving 34.9% lower routing delay, 14.7% lower MAPE, and 11.8% lower RMSE, while improving global route consistency by 7.3%.

In particular, it enables decentralized model training while preserving data privacy, but its distributed nature makes it highly vulnerable to a severe attack known as Data Poisoning. In such scenarios, malicious clients inject manipulated data into the training process, thereby degrading global model performance or causing targeted misclassification. In this paper, we present a novel defense mechanism called GShield, designed to detect and mitigate malicious and low-quality updates, especially under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data scenarios. GShield operates by learning the distribution of benign gradients through clustering and Gaussian modeling during an initial round, enabling it to establish a reliable baseline of trusted client behavior. With this benign profile, GShield selectively aggregates only those updates that align with the expected gradient patterns, effectively isolating adversarial clients and preserving the integrity of the global model. An extensive experimental campaign demonstrates that our proposed defense significantly improves model robustness compared to the state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a high accuracy of performance across both tabular and image datasets.

Purpose. To design and experimentally validate an architecture in which class concepts are formed from a handful of examples (5 - 6 per class) through structural and parametric reductions, providing transparent decisions and eliminating backpropagation. Methods. Contour vectorization is followed by constructing a bipartite graph (Point/Line as nodes) with normalized geometric attributes such as coordinates, length, angle, and direction; reductions include the elimination of unstable substructures or noise and the alignment of paths between critical points. Concepts are formed by iterative composition of samples, and classification is performed by selecting the best graph-to-concept match (using approximated GED). Results. On an MNIST subset with 5 - 6 base examples per class (single epoch), we obtain a consistent accuracy of around 82% with full traceability of decisions: misclassifications can be explained by explicit structural similarities.

Existing multi-prompt learning methods primarily focus on utilizing various meticulously designed prompts within a single foundation vision-language model to achieve superior performance. However, the overlooked model-prompt matching bias hinders the development of multi-prompt learning, i.e., the same prompt can convey different semantics across distinct vision-language models, such as CLIP-ViT-B/16 and CLIP-ViT-B/32, resulting in inconsistent predictions of identical prompt. To mitigate the impact of this bias on downstream tasks, we explore an ensemble learning approach to sufficiently aggregate the benefits of diverse predictions. Additionally, we further disclose the presence of sample-prompt matching bias, which originates from the prompt-irrelevant semantics encapsulated in the input samples. Thus, directly utilizing all information from the input samples for generating weights of ensemble learning can lead to suboptimal performance. In response, we extract prompt-relevant semantics from input samples by leveraging the guidance of the information theory-based analysis, adaptively calculating debiased ensemble weights. Overall, we propose Adaptive-Debiased Ensemble MultiPrompt Learning, abbreviated as AmPLe, to mitigate the two types of bias simultaneously.

The present study investigates whether state-of-the-art GenAI human animation models can preserve the subtle spatio-temporal details needed for person identification through gait biometrics. Specifically, we evaluate four different GenAI models across two primary evaluation tasks to assess their ability to i) restore gait patterns from reference videos under varying conditions of complexity, and ii) transfer these gait patterns to different visual identities. Our results show that while visual quality is mostly high, biometric fidelity remains low in tasks focusing on identification, suggesting that current GenAI models struggle to disentangle identity from motion.

In this study, we investigate if human and LLM ratings of the features of stigmas, along with prompt style and type of stigma, have effect on bias towards stigmatized groups in LLM outputs. We measure bias against 93 stigmatized groups across three widely used LLMs (Granite 3.0-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B) using SocialStigmaQA, a benchmark that includes 37 social scenarios about stigmatized identities; for example deciding wether to recommend them for an internship. We find that stigmas rated by humans to be highly perilous (e.g., being a gang member or having HIV) have the most biased outputs from SocialStigmaQA prompts (60% of outputs from all models) while sociodemographic stigmas (e.g. Asian-American or old age) have the least amount of biased outputs (11%).

However, in practice, existing interaction paradigms often fail to support divergent exploration: users tend to converge too quickly on early ``good enough'' results and struggle to move beyond them, leading to premature convergence and design fixation that constrains their creative potential. To address this, we propose a structured, process-oriented human-AI co-creation paradigm including divergent and convergent thinking stages, grounded in Wallas's model of creativity. To avoid design fixation, our paradigm scaffolds both high-level exploration of conceptual ideas in the early divergent thinking phase and low-level exploration of variations in the later convergent thinking phrase. We instantiate this paradigm in HAIExplore, an image co-creation system that (i) scaffolds divergent thinking through a dedicated brainstorming stage for exploring high-level ideas in a conceptual space, and (ii) scaffolds convergent refinement through an interface that externalizes users' refinement intentions as interpretable parameters and options, making the refinement process more controllable and easier to explore. We report on a within-subjects study comparing HAIExplore with a widely used linear chat interface (ChatGPT) for creative image generation. Our findings show that explicitly scaffolding the creative process into brainstorming and refinement stages can mitigate design fixation, improve perceived controllability and alignment with users' intentions, and better support the non-linear nature of creative work.

While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants have become the de facto standard for training deep networks, their success in these over-parameterized regimes often appears more empirical than principled. This thesis investigates this apparent paradox by tracing the evolution of optimization algorithms from classical first-order methods to modern higher-order techniques, revealing how principled algorithmic design can demystify the training process. Starting from first principles with SGD and adaptive gradient methods, the analysis progressively uncovers the limitations of these conventional approaches when confronted with anisotropy that is representative of real-world data. These breakdowns motivate the exploration of sophisticated alternatives rooted in curvature information: second-order approximation techniques, layer-wise preconditioning, adaptive learning rates, and more. Next, the interplay between these optimization algorithms and the broader neural network training toolkit, which includes prior and recent developments such as maximal update parametrization, learning rate schedules, and exponential moving averages, emerges as equally essential to empirical success.

Existing deep learning approaches, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), face computational challenges as dimensionality increases, driven by the $O(D^2)$ complexity of automatic differentiation for second-order derivatives. While recent probability flow approaches bypass this by learning score functions or matching velocity fields, they often involve serial computational operations or depend on sampling efficiency in complex distributions. To address these issues, we propose the Self-Consistent Probability Flow (SCPF) method. We reformulate the second-order FP equation into an equivalent first-order deterministic Probability Flow ODE (PF-ODE) constraint. Unlike score matching or velocity matching, SCPF solves this problem by minimizing the residual of the PF-ODE continuity equation, which avoids explicit Hessian computation.

Classical graphical criteria, like the back-door criterion and the generalized adjustment criterion, are powerful tools for identifying valid adjustment sets in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, these criteria are not directly applicable to summary causal graphs (SCGs), which are abstractions of DAGs commonly used in dynamic systems. In SCGs, each node typically represents an entire time series and may involve cycles, making classical criteria inapplicable for identifying causal effects. Recent work established complete conditions for determining whether the micro causal effect of a treatment or an exposure $X_{t-γ}$ on an outcome $Y_t$ is identifiable via covariate adjustment in SCGs, under the assumption of no hidden confounding. However, these identifiability conditions have two main limitations. First, they are complex, relying on cumbersome definitions and requiring the enumeration of multiple paths in the SCG, which can be computationally expensive. Second, when these conditions are satisfied, they only provide two valid adjustment sets, limiting flexibility in practical applications. In this paper, we propose an equivalent but simpler formulation of those identifiability conditions and introduce a new criterion that identifies a broader class of valid adjustment sets in SCGs. Additionally, we characterize the quasi-optimal adjustment set among these, i.e., the one that minimizes the asymptotic variance of the causal effect estimator.

Monitoring the chain-of-thought (CoT) of today's reasoning models has proven effective for detecting misbehavior. However, this \"monitorability\" may be fragile under different training procedures, data sources, or even continued system scaling. To measure and track monitorability, we propose three evaluation archetypes (intervention, process, and outcome-property) and a new monitorability metric, and introduce a broad evaluation suite. We demonstrate that these evaluations can catch simple model organisms trained to have obfuscated CoTs, and that CoT monitoring is more effective than action-only monitoring in practical settings. We compare the monitorability of various frontier models and find that most models are fairly, but not perfectly, monitorable. We also evaluate how monitorability scales with inference-time compute, reinforcement learning optimization, and pre-training model size. We find that longer CoTs are generally more monitorable and that RL optimization does not materially decrease monitorability even at the current frontier scale. Notably, we find that for a model at a low reasoning effort, we could instead deploy a smaller model at a higher reasoning effort (thereby matching capabilities) and obtain a higher monitorability, albeit at a higher overall inference compute cost. We further investigate agent-monitor scaling trends and find that scaling a weak monitor's test-time compute when monitoring a strong agent increases monitorability. Giving the weak monitor access to CoT not only improves monitorability, but it steepens the monitor's test-time compute to monitorability scaling trend. Finally, we show we can improve monitorability by asking models follow-up questions and giving their follow-up CoT to the monitor.", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.SE"], "submitted_at": "2025-12-20T10:46:04Z", "updated_at": "2025-12-20T10:46:04Z", "rl_tags": ["deep_rl"], "attention_score": 0.643, "collected_at": "2025-12-27T10:27:20.393833+00:00"}

In this work, we introduce HyDRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework designed to implement hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling for mobile VLMs. This framework incorporates two essential optimization strategies: (1) hierarchical optimization, which involves a coarse-grained approach that assigns different ranks to various layers, as well as a fine-grained method that adjusts ranks within individual layers, and (2) dynamic adjustment, which employs an end-to-end automatic optimization using a lightweight performance model to determine and adjust ranks during the fine-tuning process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks demonstrate that HyDRA consistently outperforms the baseline, achieving a 4.7\\% improvement across various model sizes without increasing the number of trainable parameters. In some tasks, it even surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning.", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "submitted_at": "2025-12-20T10:18:10Z", "updated_at": "2025-12-20T10:18:10Z", "rl_tags": ["general_dl"], "attention_score": 0.6, "collected_at": "2025-12-27T10:27:20.420077+00:00"}

A key challenge experienced in these more realistic domains is highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to the agent's observations, which are less common in small controlled domains. The predominant approach for dealing with this in the literature is to stack together a window of the most recent observations (Frame Stacking), but this window size must grow with the degree of non-Markovian dependencies, which results in prohibitive computational and memory requirements for both action inference and learning. In this paper, we are motivated by the insight that in many environments that are highly non-Markovian with respect to time, the environment only causally depends on a relatively small number of observations over that time-scale. A natural direction would then be to consider meta-algorithms that maintain relatively small adaptive stacks of memories such that it is possible to express highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to time while considering fewer observations at each step and thus experience substantial savings in both compute and memory requirements. Hence, we propose a meta-algorithm (Adaptive Stacking) for achieving exactly that with convergence guarantees and quantify the reduced computation and memory constraints for MLP, LSTM, and Transformer-based agents. Our experiments utilize popular memory tasks, which give us control over the degree of non-Markovian dependencies. This allows us to demonstrate that an appropriate meta-algorithm can learn the removal of memories not predictive of future rewards without excessive removal of important experiences.

Nevertheless, the existing industrial hybrid modeling methods still face two main limitations. First, current research has mainly focused on applying a single machine learning method to one specific task, failing to develop a comprehensive machine learning architecture suitable for modeling tasks, which limits their ability to effectively represent complex industrial scenarios. Second, industrial datasets often contain underlying associations (e.g., monotonicity or periodicity) that are not adequately exploited by current research, which can degrade model's predictive performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Recurrent Perceptron-based Channel Attention Transformer Encoder (RP-CATE), with three distinctive characteristics: 1: We developed a novel architecture by replacing the self-attention mechanism with channel attention and incorporating our proposed Recurrent Perceptron (RP) Module into Transformer, achieving enhanced effectiveness for industrial modeling tasks compared to the original Transformer. 2: We proposed a new data type called Pseudo-Image Data (PID) tailored for channel attention requirements and developed a cyclic sliding window method for generating PID. 3: We introduced the concept of Pseudo-Sequential Data (PSD) and a method for converting industrial datasets into PSD, which enables the RP Module to capture the underlying associations within industrial dataset more effectively.

What components of the reasoning chains play a key role? Existing studies mainly focus on evaluating reasoning chains from a functional perspective, with little attention paid to their structural mechanisms. To address this gap, this work is the first to analyze and evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from a structural perspective. We apply persistent homology from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to map reasoning steps into semantic space, extract topological features, and analyze structural changes.

Existing approaches either enforce a single global model that fits no one well, or rely on heuristic peer selection mechanisms that cannot distinguish between peers with genuinely incompatible data distributions and those with valuable complementary knowledge. We present Murmura, a framework that leverages evidential deep learning to enable trust-aware model personalization in DFL. Our key insight is that epistemic uncertainty from Dirichlet-based evidential models directly indicates peer compatibility: high epistemic uncertainty when a peer's model evaluates local data reveals distributional mismatch, enabling nodes to exclude incompatible influence while maintaining personalized models through selective collaboration. Murmura introduces a trust-aware aggregation mechanism that computes peer compatibility scores through cross-evaluation on local validation samples and personalizes model aggregation based on evidential trust with adaptive thresholds.

Methods: Our CA architecture first processes the iEEG signal using state-of-the-art models applied to each single channel independently. The resulting features are then fused using a vector-symbolic algorithm which reconstructs the spatial relationship using a trainable scalar per channel. Finally, the fused features are accumulated in a long-term memory of up to 2 minutes to perform the classification. Each CA-model can then be pre-trained on a large corpus of iEEG recordings from multiple heterogeneous subjects. The pre-trained model is personalized to each subject via a quick fine-tuning routine, which uses equal or lower amounts of data compared to existing state-of-the-art models, but requiring only 1/5 of the time.

To bridge this gap, our study aims to determine the extent of the adoption of AI-powered tools for SVM, identify barriers and facilitators to the use, and gather insights to help improve the tools to meet industry needs better. We conducted a survey study involving 60 practitioners from diverse industry sectors across 27 countries. The survey incorporates both quantitative and qualitative questions to analyze the adoption trends, assess tool strengths, identify practical challenges, and uncover opportunities for improvement. Our findings indicate that AI-powered tools are used throughout the SVM life cycle, with 69% of users reporting satisfaction with their current use. Practitioners value these tools for their speed, coverage, and accessibility. However, concerns about false positives, missing context, and trust issues remain prevalent. We observe a socio-technical adoption pattern in which AI outputs are filtered through human oversight and organizational governance. To support safe and effective use of AI for SVM, we recommend improvements in explainability, contextual awareness, integration workflows, and validation practices.

Although LoRA is simple, its convergence is poorly understood due to the lack of Lipschitz smoothness, a key condition for classic convergence analyses. As a result, current theoretical results only consider asymptotic behavior or assume strong boundedness conditions which artificially enforce Lipschitz smoothness. In this work, we provide for the first time a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of the \\textit{original LoRA gradient descent} algorithm, which reflects widespread practice, without such assumptions. Our work relies on three key steps: i) reformulating the problem in terms of the outer product of the stacked adapter matrices, ii) a modified descent lemma for the ``Lipschitz-like\" reparametrized function, and iii) controlling the step size.

Intelligent analysis methods have made progress in various fields of archaeology, but there remains a research gap in data and methods in archaeobotany, especially in the classification task of ancient plant seeds. To address this, we construct the first Ancient Plant Seed Image Classification (APS) dataset. It contains 8,340 images from 17 genus- or species-level seed categories excavated from 18 archaeological sites across China. In addition, we design a framework specifically for the ancient plant seed classification task (APSNet), which introduces the scale feature (size) of seeds based on learning fine-grained information to guide the network in discovering key \"evidence\" for sufficient classification. Specifically, we design a Size Perception and Embedding (SPE) module in the encoder part to explicitly extract size information for the purpose of complementing fine-grained information.

To this end, we propose a simple yet effective method, Stepwise Dual Ranking (SDR), which extracts a compact yet informative subset from large-scale offline behavioral datasets.

However, jailbreak attacks continue to pose a critical security threat by inducing models to generate policy-violating behaviors. Current paradigms focus on input-level anomalies, overlooking that the model's internal psychometric state can be systematically manipulated. To address this, we introduce Psychological Jailbreak, a new jailbreak attack paradigm that exposes a stateful psychological attack surface in LLMs, where attackers exploit the manipulation of a model's psychological state across interactions. Building on this insight, we propose Human-like Psychological Manipulation (HPM), a black-box jailbreak method that dynamically profiles a target model's latent psychological vulnerabilities and synthesizes tailored multi-turn attack strategies. By leveraging the model's optimization for anthropomorphic consistency, HPM creates a psychological pressure where social compliance overrides safety constraints. To systematically measure psychological safety, we construct an evaluation framework incorporating psychometric datasets and the Policy Corruption Score (PCS). Benchmarking against various models (e.g., GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-2-Flash), HPM achieves a mean Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 88.1%, outperforming state-of-the-art attack baselines. Our experiments demonstrate robust penetration against advanced defenses, including adversarial prompt optimization (e.g., RPO) and cognitive interventions (e.g., Self-Reminder).

To mitigate the annotation cost, strategically prioritizing and labeling high-quality unlabeled inputs for testing becomes crucial, which facilitates uncovering more model failures with a limited labeling budget. Unfortunately, existing test input prioritization techniques either overlook the valuable information contained in graph structures or are overly reliant on attributes extracted from the target model, i.e., model-aware attributes, whose quality can vary significantly. To address these issues, we propose a novel test input prioritization framework, named GraphRank, for GNNs. GraphRank introduces model-agnostic attributes to compensate for the limitations of the model-aware ones. It also leverages the graph structure information to aggregate attributes from neighboring nodes, thereby enhancing the model-aware and model-agnostic attributes. Furthermore, GraphRank combines the above attributes with a binary classifier, using it as a ranking model to prioritize inputs.
